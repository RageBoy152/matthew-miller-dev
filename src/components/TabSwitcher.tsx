At this point in my learning, I had been exposed to a handful of technologies through self-directed learning so going through the proper curriculum gave me a huge boost.",

As part of this, I developed a brand and eventually website for a Scottish mountain biking company which taught me so much about UI/UX design, improved my basic HTML and CSS knowledge and introduced me to SEO."
